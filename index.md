## Goals of the project

The goal is to study the combination of task and motion planning

## Motivation

Task planning is very good at finding a long, complicated sequence of actions to solve a task.
Motion planning is very good at finding collision free paths through a high dimensional configuration space.
The problem is that the two methods don't work so well together.
